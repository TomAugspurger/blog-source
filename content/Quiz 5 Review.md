# Section A01

## Problem 1

Make sure to read the questions carefully, in particular **the underlined or bold parts**. For this question we wanted the **statistical concept** that explains why interpreting a prediction for a car with 0 City MPG is mislaeding. I agree that a negative Highway MPG doesn't make sense physically, but that doesn't answer the question.

The statistical concept is *extrapolation*: making predictions for values outside of your sample dataset. The City MPG of 0 fell below of the lowest City MPG in our sample. We can't be confident that the relationship that we found in the sample area holds for City MPGs that low (it probably doesn't in this case).

## Problem 2

Using the formula

If $r_i$ is the indivudal contribution of website $i$ to the correlation, then

\begin{equation}
    r_i  = \left( \frac{\bar{x} - x_i}{s_x} \right) \left( \frac{\bar{y} - y_i}{s_y} \right)
\end{equation}

In this case $\bar{x} = 140.5, x_i = 138.38, s_x = 10.46, \bar{y} = 1.17, y_i =  1.007, s_y = 0.1513$

## Problem 3

You'll want to find the correlation coefficient $r$ using your calculator. Talk to me if you don't know how.
